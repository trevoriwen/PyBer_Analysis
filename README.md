# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of PyBer Analysis
The PyBer CEO tasked us with creating a multiple-line graph showing total weekly fares for Urban, Suburban, and Rural city types. This will give the PyBer decision makers insight into the total fares driven by each of the different city types over the first third of the 2019 year. We will create a summary DataFrame using Python and Pandas and then use Pandas and Matplotlib to create our graph. 

## Results of PyBer Analysis
(There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type.)

## Summary of PyBer Analysis
(There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.)
