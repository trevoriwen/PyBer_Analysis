# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of PyBer Analysis
The PyBer CEO tasked us with creating a multiple-line graph showing total weekly fares for Urban, Suburban, and Rural city types. This will give the PyBer decision makers insight into the total fares driven by each of the different city types over the first third of the 2019 year. We will create a summary DataFrame using Python and Pandas and then use Pandas and Matplotlib to create our graph. 

## Results of PyBer Analysis
(There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type.)

## Summary of PyBer Analysis
(There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.)
1. Look into mileage of each ride. Urban likely shorter trips. 
2. PyBer should look into how they can increase Urban rides or see if they are able to shift urban drivers to suburban or rural areas for a slightly higher pay which could be subsidized by the higher average fare
3. Investments would be best made to increase Rural and Urban rides. Urban because the demand for rides is significantly lower than the supply of drivers and Rural offers the highest fares but lacks a demand for rides.
